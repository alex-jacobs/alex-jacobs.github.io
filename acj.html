                                Hello! Welcome to my webpage, I'm Alex, a second year Marketing Major with a Minor in Economics. I'm chasing the dream of becoming a Pharmaceutics Sales Rep. I was born and raised in Westbrook, Maine. For those who do not know where that is, Westbrook is about two hours south of Orono. My webpage is designed to give you a little overview of my life and who I am, enjoy!</center>
