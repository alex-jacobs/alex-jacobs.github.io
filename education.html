<H1> Education Background </H1> 
<body> I grew up in the Westbrook public school system attending classes from kindergarden to half way through 10th grade. My sophomore year of high school, I decided to make a change to help broaden my future. That change involved a switch in schools. I decided to go to a college preparatory school in Portland, Cheverus High School. This was a big change for me because this school was much more rigorous than a public high school. Cheverus is a private Catholic school, this was new because I had added on a new field of study theology, the study of God. Something new was I had to wear a suit and tie to school everyday which was different at first, but you get used to it. All and all Cheverus was one of the better experiences of my life.</body>
