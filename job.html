<h1> Job History </h1>
  <body bgcolor="grey">
My first job I had was in the fall going into Junior year of High School. I worked at a Country Club my High School Golf team played at. Portland Country Club is located in Falmouth Foreside on the Ocean. It is a very scenic and picturesque course. This job by far has been my favorite. I love working outside so, that's a plus. More importantly I love playing golf, my friends also work here with me so we get to golf at one of the nicest courses in Maine for free. Another job I currently have is working at Hannaford. I don't enjoy this job as much as working at the golf course. I work in the produce department which is cold because it's a cooler set at 25 degrees. The upside though is I like the group of guys that work with me in Falmouth so it makes work more enjoyable. </body>
